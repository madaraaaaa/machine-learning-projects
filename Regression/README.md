# Car Price Prediction ðŸš—ðŸ’°  

Predicting car prices using linear regression with NumPy.  

- **EDA**: explored data, handled missing values, transformed target distribution.  
- **Validation**: train/val/test split with RMSE for evaluation.  
- **Model**: implemented Normal Equation + regularization for stability.  
- **Features**: engineered age & categorical variables to boost accuracy.  

### ðŸ“ˆ Results  

| Model Variant          | Error (RMSE) |  
|------------------------|--------------|  
| Before Regularization  | Higher / unstable |  
| After Regularization   | **0.487** |

# ML Model Deployment 🚀📦

Deploying a machine learning model as a web service using a containerized environment.

* **Model Persistence**: Learned to save a trained model with `pickle` for easy loading and reuse without retraining.

* **Web Service**: Built a Flask API to receive input data and serve real-time predictions from the model.

* **Environment Management**: Utilized a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies and ensure reproducibility.

* **Containerization**: Created a Docker container to package the entire application for seamless cross-platform deployment.

### ⚙️ Key Workflow Steps

| Phase | Technology Used | Purpose |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Environment Isolation | Pipenv / Venv | Manage dependencies consistently. |
| Model Serialization | Pickle | Save and load the trained model. |
| API Development | Flask | Expose the model via a web endpoint. |
| Application Packaging | Docker | Run the service reliably on any system. |
